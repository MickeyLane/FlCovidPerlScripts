Notes for Linux users

WHAT IS THIS?
=============

The ov script will read any number of _________ .xlsx files in a given date
directory and produce a new .csv file in that directory.

Note that this code NEVER modifies any of the source files it acts on.
It creates a new file for each date and you may change what it is named.

PREREQUSITES
============

Perl. Probably already functional on your system. To test, in any
console window, issue:

    $ perl -v (or maybe --version)

GET
===

You can get the code via git or a zip file

Git
---
Git may already be functional on your system. It isn't on my CentOS distro
but I don't care as I develop on Windows.

If you want to make changes to the scripts and contribute them to the
GitHub repository (encouraged), I suggest you use Microsoft's Visual
Studio Code (VSC) to install git. It's kind of like swatting flies with
a hammer but VSC is an excellent editor and you can configure it to
single-step through the code. Git is built in. Works for a bunch of
other stuff too.

Find a place on your computer where you would like to have a directory
called FlCovidPerlScripts. Open a console window there.

Issue the command:

   $ git clone https://github.com/MickeyLane/FlCovidPerlScripts.git

ZIP
---

Go to Github.com
Search for FlCovidPerlScripts
Go to the page and see a green button labeled Download. Choose zip

USE
===

1) Open a console window in FlCovidPerlScripts.

2) Edit ov.pl using whatever. Read the comments and change as needed.

   Issue the command:

      $ perl ov.pl

Possible perl error
-------------------
When running a perl script for the first time, you may get a message like:

  Can't locate File/chdir.pm in @INC (you may need to install the
  File::chdir module) (@INC contains: /usr/local/lib64/perl5
  /usr/local/share/perl5 /usr/lib64/perl5/vendor_perl
  /usr/share/perl5/vendor_perl /usr/lib64/perl5 /usr/share/perl5)
  at make_header.pl line 16.

This means that (in this case), the perl module File::chdir
is missing from your perl installation.

Issue the command:

   $ yum (stuff goes here)
   
Use Google to find out how to update your perl using yum.

On my vanilla CentOS system, I had to install

   DateTime
   File::chdir
   Spreadsheet::Read

You are done. Examine new files in each date directory

Notes
-----
As configured, ov will create missing date directories in whatever root directory
you are using. Code exists to make this configurable via command line switches but that part
is commented out
